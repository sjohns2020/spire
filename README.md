            pip install pytest==2.9.1
            pip install pytest-assume==1.2

    - Open this repo in codespaces (simpler) where the dev envrionment will be automatically created.
      - Instructions for getting started with codespaces:

            Create your own branch of the repo

            Click the <>code button at the top of the repo

            Select the codespaces tab

            Create a codespace in your branch



<small> **The repo thatâ€™s been shared with you, contains all the files you will need to complete the tasks. You will not require any further packages to be installed to complete the tasks** </small>

## Please commit your changes / answers to your own branch to be discussed during on-site visit.

The py files named `test_onboard_comp, test_onboard_comp2, test_power_unit, test_power_unit2, test_power_unit3 and test_power_unit4` are tests utilizing some pytest capabilities.

Run each of them separately and find the reason for failure, if there is a failure at all.

Commands to be run:

py.test -rs -v -s -k test_power_unit.py

py.test -rs -v -s -k test_power_unit2.py

py.test -rs -v -s -k test_power_unit3.py

py.test -rs -v -s -k test_power_unit4.py

py.test -rs -v -s -k test_onboard_comp.py

Open the file `test_onboard_comp2.py` and read the instructions before you run:

py.test -rs -v -s -k test_onboard_comp2.py

The file `mock_sat.py` contains a simple satellite class. Please review the file to have an idea of what the functions are doing and work through the following:

- Create a sample object of that class

- Making use of the satellite's MockAi class, what is the difference between `Btp.ping()` and `btp.ping()` functions? Are they both working as expected? If not, why?

- What is the value for the `MockAi()` channels variable? Can you set it to a different number? Is it mutable?

- Write a function that will evaluate the result of the `get_store_status()` function in the `MockAi()` class and increase the "error" output if the difference between the seq and the count is more than 1

- Create a handle of the `MockOb()` and call the `ob.bootcount()` function. Is it working? If not, why? How would you make it return the value we want?

- Make a call of the MockOb's shell function by running `shell("cat /proc/cmdline")`. What is the value of the "root" field? How would you make it print out "ubi0_0" instead?

- Use the shell function to reset the bootcount and re-run the `shell("cat /proc/cmdline")` command. Does that change the "root" value? How would you make it work, i.e. when the bootcount is reset, make the "root" value in the `shell("cat /proc/cmdline")` print out the correct value.
